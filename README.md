All this coming in at around 250 lines total.

## Setup

1. Install:
   1. Python 3.10+
   2. [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)
   3. [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
2. Run:
   1. `poetry install`

      For best experience, issue `poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true` before this step, such that a `.venv` will be created in your current directory upon installation.
      This is generally easier for IDEs and tooling to pick up on.
   2. `make serverup`
